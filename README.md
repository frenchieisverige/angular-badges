# Angular-badges

Through this App, I could put in pratice the fundamentals of Angular2 and Firebase learned on Youtube.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This AngularApp was fully developped under Linux. The linux distribution used was Arch Linux 4.11.3-1-ARCH. Moreover, a core software is required on the server side in order to run this app: NodeJS.

```
yaourt -Syy nodejs
```
This will also install `npm`, required to install some other packages:
```
yaourt -Syy typescript @angular/cli
```
### Installing

Once all this software are installed on the server side, you can clone this repo and launch a quick web server:
```
ng serve
```
Then, open your web browser, and go to `http://localhost:4200/` to interact with the App!
